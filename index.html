        <h1><u>How to maintain Curly Hair</u></h1>

        <p>Curly hair is very <b>fragile</b> and needs to be maintained to keep healthy.</p>

        <h3>Why does curly hair need to be continually taken care of?</h3>

        <p>Keeping your hygiene and caring for your body is always a necessity. So why is taking care of curls so important? It will help majorly with damaged hair as well as keeping a good curl pattern and finding out what that is for you. Here is my routine that I've used for years that keeps up my curl pattern and defines it perfectly.
        </p>

        <h3>Curly Hair Routine</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Use shampoo and conditioner fit to your hair type.</li>
            <li>Brush hair out in the shower.</li>
            <li>Put curl cream evenly throughout your curls (once you're out of the shower.</li>
            <li>Apply leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li>Use a <b>denman brush</b> to define curls.</li>
            <li>Scrunch gel in your curls.</li>
            <li>Finally allow curls to air-dry or diffuse to dry</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>What is your Curl Pattern?</h3>

        <p>Your pattern is the type of curls you have. Determines if you have tight curls, loose curls, ringlets, waves.etc. Your pattern is known by a letter and a number. For example my curl pattern ranges from 3A to 3B curls. What does that mean? That means my curls looks like and be desribed as loose, and ringlets. Depending on how I define my curls with my <b>denman brush</b> they can be tighter curls as well. What helps people determine their curl type is with the "Curl Pattern Chart." What you will see is the different numbers and letter I told you about. The higher the number will tell you how tight your curls are. Lowest being a 1 which is straight hair, 2 being wavy hair, 3 is curly hair, and finally a 4 is coily hair. The letter tells you somewhat the same thing, showing you as well how curly is your hair in the chart. For reference the letter "A" is the "lowest" so for example 2A hair would be a little wave that is just barely not straight. The letter "B" would be a medium, again for example 2B could consist of having more of a visible wave. Lastly "C" would be the tightest curl in and type number. 2C hair wouldn't be as much as a wave anymore but now visible very loose curls. </p>
